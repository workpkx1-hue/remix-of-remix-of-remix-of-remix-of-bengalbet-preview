# Bonus alignment audit — 2026-11-02

## Verified live
- The newly linked BengalBet Server connection can read the current PHP source and database schema.
- All five administrator sections return HTTP 404: daily-signin/config, vip/stats, rescue/tiers, promos, mystery-reward/config. These are missing PHP handlers, not merely frontend navigation failures.
- One new isolated audit member registered through the browser; the same account subsequently logged in successfully. No other member was accessed.
- Wallet and member daily-signin, VIP, rescue, promo and mystery status reads succeeded with no browser page errors. The audit member balance remains 500 after read-only checks; no bonus claim, deposit or withdrawal was submitted.
- Browser rendering of the mystery modal with that member's real status showed the claim button disabled. This was an isolated component check; ordinary navigation to that modal was not verified.
- Eleven focused automated tests passed; preview build output reports build OK.

## Actual workflow and discrepancies
| Feature | Current server behavior | Alignment problem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Welcome | Registration directly creates balance 500, five spins, one egg, three packets and a welcome transaction | These values are hardcoded in auth.php, not demonstrated adjustable admin settings |
| Daily sign-in | Status calculates 1 + day × 1.5; claim calculates 2 + day × 1.5; cycle is 30 | First-day preview 2.50 differs from credit 3.50; missed-day and rollover calculation differs between status and claim; no administrator config handler |
| VIP | Claim selects requested tier and type and credits its configured amount | No tier eligibility or repeat-claim validation in inspected claim source; a nonpositive or unknown reward falls back to 50 |
| Rescue | Status uses loss and active tier; claim adds a consolation fallback | With zero loss the status shows zero but claim code awards 10; caller-supplied date is not bounded |
| Promo codes | Checks active code, usage limit, prior redemption and minimum VIP | No expiry validation in inspected redeem code; all types are credited as cash rather than separate percentage/free-spin fulfillment |
| Mystery | Status reports the 23rd after 18:00 and monthly bet threshold 500 | Claim checks previous claim but not date/time, betting eligibility or verification; defaults to 2500. Status omits editable config |

Marketing promises therefore cannot be certified: signup → benefit eligibility → claim → wallet credit → transaction must use the same server-authoritative rules at every step. Current preview/credit, eligibility and configurable-setting differences break that chain.

## Safe frontend corrections completed
- Mystery reward now fails closed on absent eligibility data, closed events, existing claims and disabled config; in-flight claims cannot be repeated.
- Removed fabricated mystery wager progress and hardcoded promo-code copying; reads actual status/config instead.
- Rescue, promo and mystery administrator load failures clear stale records and display an error rather than pretending that an empty list means success.

## Blocked work
- Adding or modifying live administrator/financial handlers requires a protected restorable backup and a separate staging DBServer with isolated funds. Neither has been supplied or verified. No live PHP uploads were made.
- Authenticated admin browser checks require a distinct scoped administrator session. The operational connector credential must not be copied into browser storage as a login.
- Source inspection found a universal password fallback in live auth.php; this needs removal and staging regression before marketing or real-money use. No attempt was made to exploit it or access another member.
- Award claims, duplicate/concurrent settlement, editable admin settings, referral eligibility and all other promotion types remain unverified end-to-end.
